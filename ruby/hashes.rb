# 5.2: Data Structures
# Release 2: pseudocode and write a program that will allow an interior designer to enter the details of a given client: the client's name, age, number of children, decor theme, and so on (you can choose your own as long as it's a good mix of string, integer, and boolean data).

# declare variable client information and set it equal to an empty hash
# ask user for client's name
  # store name in variable (str)
# ask user for client's age
  # store age as variable (int)
# ask user for client's number of children
  # store number of children as variable (int)
# ask user for client's decor theme
  # store decor theme as variable (str)
# ask user if client has pet's (true or false)
  # store response as boolean variable
# print hash
# ask user if anything needs to be updated (type 'none' to exit)
  # store response as variable
  # if user types a symbol in the hash, ask "What is the updated value?"
    # store response as variable
    # update hash with updated value
# print hash
